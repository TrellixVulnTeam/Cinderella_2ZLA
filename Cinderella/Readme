Project made to Alternative Solutions course (Prorammer-Analyst Program at NBCC) - class of 2020

I had a couple of months to design and present my own project attending some criteria:
1) must be an information technology project;
2) must use a technology, language or platform not delivered as part of NBCCâ€™s ITPA regular curriculum;
3) must be presentable to the instructor;
4) must not violate NBCC policies including, but not restricted to, the Student Code of Conduct and Academic Integrity.

After a brief research, I decided to develop an app because it would be challenging. I needed to study a new language, I did some research but I couldn't decide, so a friend told me that I could use Kivy (Python) to build it, so I did.

At that time, I worked at a local hotel where I could see some problems in the Housekeeping sector and they could be losing money and overwhelming housekeepers unnecessarily.

Cinderella is a software that will distribute the rooms in the best possible way to the employees, in order to guarantee the maximum balance of the workload among all the attendants. It has only two goals: Improve housekeepers' quality of life and save money to the company (WIN-WIN).

The UI-UX might not be good and it may have a lot of residual code from my previous attempts. But it's functional, would help housekeepers and, doing the math, it has the potential to save about $15,000 yearly to this specific company.
